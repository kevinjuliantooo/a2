 <p><em><strong>PMI:</strong></em>
 <li>Pluses: During the process of whole assignment2, our group members have learnt many different things from both lecture lessons and online researches. We managed to generate ideas from the process, separating tasks to our team members, builds up our communication. We also learn that the importance of online file sharing(github/google drive), containing it as a backup file as well. </li></p>
 <p><li>Minuses: Even though we managed to finish our project , there are few flaws in our working process, we could not managed our time well, causing drags of the process of our assignment. </li></p>
 <p><li>Interesting:</li>We learn that time management is very important and we will try to improve ourselves on that. We learn a lot of new features and stuffs through user testing as well, it broadened our knowledge to a whole new level.</p>
